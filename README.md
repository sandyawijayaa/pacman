# pacman

Class project from CS61B: Data Structures, taken in Spring 2022.

This project involved applying complex search algorithms to Pacman, allowing the agent to find paths through his maze world to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Some specific algorithms used are Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Expectimax, Uniform Cost Search or Greedy Best-First Search. 

This project also involved implementing heuristic functions for the Corners game (evaluate the state of the game) and Food Search (assess desirability of different states).
